Greetings,

I have seven inmates taking SDS courses and I just got the first reply from one. She’s doing Paper 113. Seraphic Guardians of Destiny and sent in her comments and answers to the quiz. I, of course, had to re-read the Paper, the SDS course and take the quiz as well, and we both have some comments about some of the quiz questions.

The title of the Paper is “Seraphic Guardians of Destiny” so why do the questions use the word “angels?” I think for consistency in education seraphim (or cherubim or sanobim as relevant) should be used.

Correct answers in red; stated answers in red bold some answers show citations, not all – too much work:

Which of these is a concern to guardian angels (select all that apply)?
Our prayers or appeals (113:5.3 no)

Interfering in our choices (of course not; human will is not abridged)
